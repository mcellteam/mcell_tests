There is some weird geometry initialization in MCell3
and some edges were not initialized although the 
geometry is fine.

Asserts with:
mcell: ../../src4/mcell3_world_converter.cpp:530: bool MCell::MCell3WorldConverter::convert_wall_and_update_regions(const wall*, MCell::GeometryObject&, const region_list*): Assertion `e != nullptr' failed.
